      <h2>The Invention of LEGO Bricks</h2>
      <p>The LEGO Group was founded in 1932 in Billund, Denmark, by Ole Kirk Christiansen, a skilled carpenter facing tough economic times during the Great Depression. Originally, 
        the company produced wooden toys, stepladders, and ironing boards. Christiansen named the company “LEGO,” derived from the Danish phrase “leg godt,” meaning “play well.” 
        Unbeknownst to him at the time, “LEGO” also translates to “I put together” in Latin—a fitting coincidence for what the company would become.
      </p>
      <p>As plastic manufacturing gained popularity after World War II, LEGO began experimenting with new materials. In 1949, they released the "Automatic Binding Bricks," early 
        versions of the interlocking pieces we recognize today. These bricks featured a unique stud-and-tube design, allowing for stable, stackable connections. This design was 
        patented in 1958 and remains the core of LEGO construction even now. Though initially met with skepticism, the bricks grew in popularity due to their durability, versatility, and imaginative potential.
      </p>
      <p>Over the decades, LEGO transformed from a small toy manufacturer into a global icon. The company expanded into themed sets, robotics, video games, movies, and even theme parks. 
        But its foundation lies in Ole Kirk Christiansen’s commitment to quality and creativity. What started as a small carpentry business in a Danish workshop became a universal 
        symbol of learning through play—one brick at a time.
