      <h2>Generation to Generation</h2>
      <p>LEGO was founded by Ole Kirk Christiansen, a Danish carpenter, in 1932 in Billund, Denmark. Originally, Christiansen crafted wooden toys in his small workshop. The name "
        LEGO" comes from the Danish phrase "leg godt," meaning "play well."</p>
      <p>In 1947, the company transitioned from wood to plastic, introducing the iconic interlocking LEGO bricks in 1949, and refining their design into the form we know today by 1958. After Ole Kirk's passing in 1958, leadership was handed down to his son, 
        Godtfred Kirk Christiansen. Under Godtfred, LEGO expanded significantly, introducing themed sets and the innovative LEGO Minifigure in 1978.</p>
      <p>In 1979, Godtfred’s son, Kjeld Kirk Kristiansen, took over leadership, becoming CEO and further globalizing the brand. Kjeld introduced innovations like LEGO Technic and 
        drove major international growth until stepping down in 2004. The Christiansen family has maintained ownership and influence, now spanning four generations, 
        making LEGO one of the most successful family-run businesses worldwide.
