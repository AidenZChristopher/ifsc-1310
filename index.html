          <h2>Progressive Enhancement Writing Assignment</h2>
          <p>Progressive enhancement is a strategy that builds websites from the content up rather than the features down. 
          The goal is to prioritize content so that users on older devices or browsers with fewer features can still access  
          the page. It begins with HTML to structure the content, followed by CSS to style it, and then JavaScript to introduce 
          interactivity and behavior. This approach helps avoid issues caused by browser updates or device limitations. <br>

          <h2>Final Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
          <p> <strong>Learning experience on this project</strong><br>
          Nothing on this project was inherently new, and there was a live demo in class, so the real learning experience was 
          having to get over the impostor syndrome and remind myself that I know how to code a whole website. Once I looked at my 
          old projects and reminded myself how to set up the project, I began working without a problem.</p>

          <p><strong>Experience during the semester</strong><br>
          I had positive experiences during this semester. I had zero experience with HTML, CSS, and JS, just prior coding knowledge, 
          so I understood a lot of the concepts, but was learning the code for the first time. I enjoyed learning CSS, and when we began to 
          implement CSS into our programs, it felt very rewarding.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Things I did well?</strong><br>
          You did a good job of explaining new coding languages/scripts to newbies. I also enjoyed learning in your classroom. 
          You are knowledgeable about your field, and you make it engaging.
          </p>
        
          <p><strong>Do things differently if you had to start over?</strong><br>          
          If I had to start over, I would experiment on my own more. I was really busy this semester, so I didn’t get to 
          play with a lot of the things I learned in class, and I feel like that left me with a shallow understanding of certain things.</p>

          <p><strong>Feedback received and what I am going to do with it.</strong><br>The feedback I received about my project was on my 
            home page the pictures about the generations are too small, the arrows on the slideshow change heights, you cant 
            click on the slideshow for a link, “Info about sets” isn't intuitive to older ages, my headers should be more distinct, 
            and I need to follow pattern of either having text to the left or center. Feedback on other pages revolved mainly around 
            readability.<br> I agree with most of the feedback that I should make the images and headers larger is a simple visual change that 
            would make my website more appealing. Adding links to the slideshow is something I didn’t think about but I watched my users test to try 
            and click on it for a link and figured that would be a very useful feature. Also to keep formatting the same I should make the text follow 
            the same pattern throughout the whole thing.</p>
