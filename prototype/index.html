                The University of Arkansas at Little Rock (UA Little Rock) is a public research university 
                in Little Rock, Arkansas. Established as Little Rock Junior College by the Little Rock 
                School District in 1927, the institution became a private four-year university under the 
                name Little Rock University in 1957. It returned to public status in 1969 when it merged 
                with the University of Arkansas System under its present name. The former campus of Little 
                Rock Junior College is now (2019) the campus of Philander Smith University.
